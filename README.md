# What you will learn?
This course will teach you all you need to know to build personal or commercial applications using Asp.Net Core (.NET 5) Web API as your development framework. You will start from just Visual Studio and build your app from the ground up.

As data storage, you will use an SQL database and Entity Framework will be used to interact with your data. You will also learn how to update database schema using Entity Framework migrations, how to add data to the database, get data from the database, update data in the database and also delete data from the database.

You will not only learn about the default features or capabilities that Asp.Net Core 5 Web API has to offer, but you will also create your custom implementations. For example, you will learn how to implement your custom Web API return type, how to build a custom exception, or even a custom middleware exception handler.

You will learn all these, step by step with hands-on practice. You will also have a lot of quizzes that will help to improve your knowledge of Web API.

Some of the topics that this course covers are:

- Introduction to Web API
- Building your first Asp.Net Core (.NET 5) API
- Working with relational data
- Controller Action return types
- Error & Exception handling
- Sorting, Filtering, and Paging
- Web API Versioning
- Unit Testing
- Logging information
- Deploying your app and database to Azure

and much more...

You will find a branch for each part/clip with a begin and an end state.

For example for part 13 you have 2 branches:
- begin-13: this has the initial state of the code
- end-13: this has the end state of the code
